    "## So what did we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "At a practical level, we have *forked* code from the Pace of Change [git repository](https://github.com/tedunderwood/paceofchange) and created a new *branch* containing the Jupyter Notebook you are reading now. Transforming Underwood and Seller's code from a set of python script into the notebook involved a series of transformation to their code. The provenance of this effort has been preserved because we did all of our work in the the fork of their version repository, visible via the `git history` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underwood and Sellers' have crafted their code in such a way that it is possible to replicate their results by running a single command. One of our first tasks was to trace the code and follow the path of execution from the initial command to the output data files. In reading through the code (spanning across multiple python scripts) we could piece together a rough idea of how Underwood and Sellers' performed their data preparation, normalization, and analysis. While we could read their python source code, plain text files leave much to be desired with trying to critically engage code. This is why we made the effort to translate their scripts into a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of translation involved copying bits of code from various `.py` files into a single executable notebook.  Not all of the code in the git repository was copied into the notebook for three main reasons. First, not all of the code included in the files was actually needed to replicate the analysis process. The repository includes extra code, one could call it \"cruft\", from Underwood and Seller's exploratory analysis or earlier iterations of the analytical process. For example, the file `SonicScrewdiver.py` is never called upon although, based upon the name, we might hypothesize it is an important catch-all module for a variety of different tasks. Other sections of the code are commented out (such as `binormal_select` discussed below) and never executed. As part of the defactoring process, we opted to not include unused functions or code blocks. The second reason for not include could was not all of the possible execution paths are represented in this Notebook. There six allowable options for slicing the data in `replicate.py`, the entry-point for re-running the analysis. In this notebook we follow the default, \"full\", which models the entire dataset. The third reason we did not include some code was because of the use of external libraries. While most of the scripts are bespoke code for working with unique data, some sections of the code lik the logistic regression are part of a third-party library, `scikit-learn`, that for a multitude of reasons (including practicality) we decided to \"step over\" and not defactor. When trying to follow the path of execution for any program one needs to recognize it is \"[turtles all the way down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down).\" To make our task possible, we have to make a decision about how far down the path of execution the defactoring process will go. We make a decision to focus only on the code written by Underwood and Sellers and leave an analysis of subsequent third-party libraries to a later, and more ambitious, defactoring effort."

Through the process of *defactoring* we have copied|move|transferred|imported code from text files to a Jupyter Notebook. This process has transformed the flow of the code, but not the outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the code to execute seamlessly within the notebook, we had to make minor changes and tweaks to the code. These changes fall into 5 categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *defactoring functions* - This is the most significant of the changes. When we defactor a function we take the function's code and move it to the global namespace. This has the effect of elimiating the function and just making it part of the main execution path. \n",
    "* *defactoring function calls* - When a function has been defactored, it can no longer be called since there is no explicit definitional code.\n",
    "* *defactoring definitions* - Not all functions can be fully defactored. Functions that are called more than once or those that are short have been kept as re-usable functions. Defactoring Definition cells define the functions above the code cells that use them (preventing errors).\n",
    "* *defactoring namespace* - Because we have defactored some of the functions and their function calls some of the variables in the namespace need to be mapped to eachother. This happens we the return value of a defactored function needs to be stored in a differently named variable.\n",
    "* *defactoring inspections* - When we want to inspect the state of the process, we insert an inspection cell that prints the values of the variables of interest.\n",
    "* *defactoring import* - Because the code is reliant upon external and third party functions, we need to import that code into the global namespace. This cell contains all of those imports.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages to defactoring a function is it affords us the ability to insert critical commentary (in the form of markdown cells) into the code constituting the function itself. An unfortunate side-effect is that this makes keeping track of one's place in the code a bit difficult. "

    "We begin this journey into code by importing a series of python libraries into working memory. Some of these libraries are part of the standard library–`os`, `csv`, `random,` and `multiprocesing`–but other libraries are third-party–`numpy`, `pandas`, and most importantly `sklearn`. These import statements tell us what libraries the authors will be relying upon for their analysis. The last line imports the `LogisticRegression` implementation from the [scikit-learn library](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html). The authors are [standing on the shoulders of giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants) to use this popular python implementation of logistic regression to conduct their analysis. Another interesting import statement is the `Pool` function from the python `multiprocessing` library. Normally python operates as a [single-threaded process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock), which means it requires some extra work to do parallel processing. This import statement enables the use of a [worker pool](https://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html#using-a-pool-of-workers) to execute code in parallel. It is important to recognize these two libraries as they will play an important role in the analysis below."

    "The parameters defined in the code cell above are a set of knobs and switches used to tweak the performance and execution of the computational modeling process below. There isn't any complex or hard-to-discern logic in the code above, it is mainly setting the parameters of a set of variables.

These categories are simultaneously distingushed discursively through the code comments (the lines beginning with a `#`) and technologically through the four variables  `paths`, `exclusions`, `thresholds`, and `classifyconditions`.

Additional exclusions specify temporal boundaries from 1700 to 1950. An additiona set of two variables in `thresholds` also articulate a temporal boundary from 1800 to 1925. The authors comments indicate this distinguishes the temporal window for datasets using in *training* versus *prediction.* The variables in `classifyconditions` are important parameters for the logistic regression, specifying the number of variables to train the model upon as well as setting the regularization parameter (`regularization`) for the logistic regression.

At a high level, the code in this cell is loading the metadata and determining what volumes to exclude in the analysis.

This means they are \"known\" and, according to the authors's comment, trumps the conflict when the author is known (`obscure = 'known'`) but not explicitly in the reviewed set. \n",

All of the poems with the `addcanon` property are tossed out and the conflict, where the poem is known by in the random set, never appears to occur. Conjector: is this a remnant of the author's refactoring the code due to changes in the analysis process or just working with different data or something we cannot possible conceive. What was the author's intent? \n",

    "We know that poems with the `addcanon` in the `recept` column are being excluded because they are included in the `excludeif` dictionary. Why? The code in the code cell above in the [setting parameters section](#setting-parameters) provides somewhat of an explanation:\n",

That makes us look stupid, but we also now have a more intimate understanding and relationship with the code. or maybe we are still stupid.\n",

We also observe the raw metadata csv file has many additional columns that are not reflected in the python dictionary.

Furthermore, the metadata now lives in a native python datastructure making it very easy to manipulate in code."

This block of code (from lines 13 to 29) makes an un-excuted reference to a function `sort_by_proximity` that samples from the negative elements with an equal distribution based upon some function of proximity. Because this code isn't executing we are not going to spend more time and analytical attention to exactly how this fuction operates. Furthermore, we have not included the code for `sort_by_proximity()` in the notebook because it is not part of the execution path we are tracing. In the code's garden of forking paths, this is a path not taken.\n",

Leveraging the affordances of the notebook platform allow us the ability to interact with the execution environment described in the code. At each step of the incremental process building this environment we can ask it questions by inspecting the state of variables (or even change them). This is more than simply treating the code as a text, the code is but one part of a complex assemblage we have been manipulating with the authors's code (and some of our own). However, as we *defactor* the authors's code, we make choices about how much to include for the argument we are trying to make (and for the sake of our time and attention). So we are dealing with a *code-criticism conundrum*: What is the required or adequate breadth and depth of the critique? The decision to include or not include `sort_by_proximity()` is a breadth issue. How broad should we be in including code that does not execute? Note, we are including code from a conditional block that doesn't execute, but are not going out the additional step to include non-executed functions defined elsewhere in the code. The decision to include or not include code from the standard library, code not written by the authors, is a depth issue. While there are many functions we are *stepping over*, like `len`, `list`, `append`, `pop`, `random.sample`, we argue there is no need to *step into* these functions because they were not written by the authors. Again, this raises the problematic issue of our decision to step over `sort_by_proximity()` even though it was written by the authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full reflexivity here would also mean that we note that the 'rules of the game' for code criticism aren't quite clear yet and therefore we are possibly feeling our way through an emerging methodological standard of practice for code criticism. As we see vestiges of the authors's evolution in thinking in their code, this notebook is capturing the evolution of our thinking about DEFACTORING as a practice. \n",

The code first prints out the number of positive and negative instancies by checking the length (using `len()`) of the volume ids stored in the `positives` and `negatives` variables. Two `for` loops iterate over these lists and populate two more variables, `IDsToUse` and `classdictionary`. The first, `IDsToUse` contains a master list of all the volume identifiers to be used in the analysis. It is of the python set datatype meaning there will be no duplicate identifiers in the set list. The second, `classdictionary` is a python dictionary that allows a simple boolean lookup to see if a volumn ID is in the positive or negative class–as indicated by a `0` or a `1`. There is a final loop whose logic checks to see if any volumes have the a specific metadata flag. We have added a defactoring statement to see if this logic is ever triggered. The output indicates the `if` statement's conditions were never satistfied.\n",

Because this is a *supervised* machine learning exercise, the authors need labeled data to train the model. All of the work in this section of the code was dedicated to assigning a class label (positive or negative) to the identifiers of the data files. The next section dives into the actual data itself."

The spike on the right end of this chart shows the 18 words that appear in all 720 documents (as we can see in the text table above). As a whole, most of the higher bars are on the left side of the chart indicating most of the words appear in fewer documents. In the course of data preparation it is important to inspect the shape of our data, in this case to visualize the distribution of our features. While it may not have a direct impact upon our analysis, it does provide a deeper perspective on the various transformations of our data. The chart above looks a lot different than the word frequency files of the poetry volumes at the start (or even of the original poems themselves). "

    "The author's code above does not actually perform any work as each line has been commented out, however we have decided to include it because it points towards an execution path and an interesting rationale for why it was not followed. In the \"production\" code the heuristic for feature selection is to simply to select the 3200 most common words by their appearance in the 720 documents. This is a simple and easy technique to implement and–more importantly–explain. Selecting the top words is a well established practice in text analysis and it has a high degree of methodologically face validity. It a good mechanism for removing features that have diminishing returns. However, the commented code above tells a different, and methodologically significant, story.\n",

    "The comment discusses an alternative technique for feature selection using binormal selection, which he has implemented in the function `binormal_selection`. Because this function is commented out and not used in the analysis, we have opted to not include it as part of the defactoring. Instead, we have decided to focus on the more interesting  rationale about *why* `binormal_selection` is not being used in the analysis as indicated in the author's comments:\n",

    "This comment reveals much about the reasoning, the effort, and energy focused on the important, but oft neglected in the humanities, work of discussing methodology. As Underwood argued in the *[Literary uses of high-dimensional space](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2053951715602494)* (2015) and repeatedly [on](https://tedunderwood.com/2013/06/11/on-not-trusting-people-who-promise-to-use-their-powers-for-good/) [his](https://tedunderwood.com/2015/12/02/emerging-conversations-between-literary-history-and-sociology/) [blog](https://tedunderwood.com/2016/05/04/versions-of-disciplinary-history/), while there is enourmous potential for the application of statistical methods in humanistic fields like literary history there is resistance to these methods because there is a resistance to *methodology*. Underwood has described the humanities disciplines relationship to methodology as an [\"insistence on staging methodology as ethical struggle\"](https://tedunderwood.com/2013/12/14/the-imaginary-conflicts-disciplines-create/). In this commented code we can see the meterial manifestation of Underwood's sentiment, in this case embodied by self-censorship in the decision to not use more statistically robust techniques for featues selection. We do not argue this choice compromises the analysis or final conclusions, rather we want to highlight the practical and material ways a resistance to diversity in research methods manifests in the digital humanities.

    "In an algorithmic, data driven analysis, the selection of features is a *crucial* step because it effects the performance of the algorithm. In the digital humanities, feature selection is deeply inflected with the theory of the analysis and the context of the data. Claims made in and through this kind of analysis must attend to the representational configuration of the data. That is to say, we cannot take for granted how we have transformed data and what data are included or excluded from the analysis. Care, in the form of thorough documentation and thoughtful reflection, must be taken–especially at this unique moment as we are still learning how algorithmic, data-driven techniques can be leveraged to better understand our objects of study. \n",

Note, we are generating this graph by counting the length of the list containing the volume IDs of other volumes by the same author. This means volumes written by the same author are counted twice. This isn't an issue for the purposes of our inspection, just that the sum total number of volumes represented by this histogram is greater than 720. "

    "This code cell defines two functions to be used below when opening and parsing the raw data files (in the `poems/` diretory). The function `get_features()` simply takes the wordcounts from the parsed volume and filters out any words that are not part of `wordlist`, which contains the list of word features that had been selected for this analysis. We have also included a second function, `get_features_with_date()`, even though it is not executed. This residual code points to yet another path not taken, one that uses the volume's publication date as a feature.

The code loops over the `volspresent` variable and parses each individual volume into the `voldict` dictionary. At this stage the code is reading in all of words, their frequencies, and tabulating the total number of words in that volume. Once all of the data for the volume has been read into memory, the code calls the `get_features` function that throws out the words not part of the selected word features stored in the `vocablist` variable.

    "The inspection above shows us the last volume processed by the loop, The croakers by Joseph Rodman Drake. As we can see, the words for this volume of poetry are now represended as a list of numbers (representing word frequencies). However, this list of numbers still requires additional transformation in order to be consumable by the Logistic Regression. The word frequencies need to be normalized so they are comparable across volumes. To do this Underwood and Sellers divide the frequency of each individual word (each number in the list above) by the total number of words in that volume (the `totalcount` variable. This makes volumes of different lengths comparable by turning absolute frequecies into relative frequencies. One thing we didn't quite understand at first is why the value of 0.001 has been added to the `totalcount` variable. When we asked, it turns out this is a [\"lazy\" way to prevent divide-by-zero errors](https://twitter.com/Ted_Underwood/status/826098272225918977).\n",

    "The three lines of code above hide a significant amount of intellectual and computational work. The call to the `newmodel.fit()` function is a crucial step in the analytical process, but unfortunately far outside of the scope of effort we delinated for the current defactoring effort. Underwood and Sellers are using an implementation of Logistic Regression from the 3rd party Python library [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/). Curious readers can look at the source code [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/14031f6/sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py#L1138), but instead of diving into the code we are going to provide a non-mathy description of what is happening in that function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a very high level, logistic regression is a machine learning algorithm for performing classification. Logistic regression works by estimating the parameters of a function, the *hypothesis representation*, that divides a multidimensional space into two parts (note, in this case we are talking about binomial or binary logistic regression, which classifies things into one of two bins). The hypothesis representation describes a line that winds its way through the space creating what is called the *decision boundary.* Every data point that lands on one side the boundary gets one label and every data point on the other side of the boundary gets the other label. Similar to linear regression, the goal is to find the best hypothesis representation, that is, the function that best draws a line dividing the space given the known data points. Once you have a good hypothesis representation, an appropriately *fit* model, you can begin to classify *new* data by dropping the into the multidimensional space and seeing on which side of the decision boundary they land.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to logistic regression is estimating the parameters of the hypothesis representation–the parameters to the function that draws a line through the multidimensional space. We can derive the parameters by using the *features* of existing data combined with their known labels; this is called *training data*. The modeling process, the function call to `newmodel.fit(trainingset, yvals)` in Underwood and Sellers's code, uses training data–the matrix of word features in the `data` variable and known labels ('reviewed' or 'random') in the `classvector` variable–to \"learn\" the parameters through a process called *gradient descent* (note: scikit-learn uses a different process called [*coordinate descent*](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression) that is exceptionally complex). How gradient descent or the more advanced optimization functions like coordinate descent work are well beyond the scope of the discussion (and our explanatory power) so we will just nod and gesture towards the mathematical magic performed by the `newmodel.fit(trainingset, yvals)` function call.\n",

    "##### Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems when fitting a logistic regression model is a tendency towards *overfitting*. Crudely this means the model, the function witht the learned parameters, that you estimated have tailored themselves such that they are overly optimized to the particular training data you provided. As such, the model becomes less useful for *prediction* or classifying new data because they are outside the fitness of the model. An overfit model is like a snug pear of jeans, once you put on a few pounds (add new data) they don't fit. In Underwood and Sellers's case, they are fitting models on all volumes *except one*, which is *held out.* Then they test the predictive performance of the model by seeing if it correctly classifies the held-out volume. If they *overfit* the models, the model will to a terrible job guessing the status of the held out volumes. \n",
    "\n",
    "When Underwood and Sellers instantiated the model (`newmodel = LogisticRegression(C = regularization)`), the set a regularization parameter on the model. Regularization is a technique for logistic regression (and other machine learning algorithms) that smooths out the tendency toward overfitting with some more mathematical gymnastics that we don't quite have the power to explain with words, but can explain visually. The diagram below shows how regularization can help with the fitness of the model:"

    "\n",
    "In the grand scheme of things, logistic regression isn't actually that complicated of a supervised learning algorithm (compared to algorithms like [support vector machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) or [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning)). Logistic regression has the advantage of being powerful, theoretically grounded (in the statistical sense), and easy to understand how it makes assertions (unlike deep learning). This relative simplicity is exceptually important because when we make computationally inflected claims in the digital humanities, we need to be able to *explain* them and understand just *how* such assertions are derived.

Looking at the code, specifically the call to `sliceframe()` reveals this model actually does have some hold-out data, the first volume at index zero. We suspect the cost of excluding a single volume is less than the effort of re-implementing the `sliceframe()` function. The code to instantiate and train the model is identical to the code above, but instead of predicting the status of the held-out data the code extracts the coefficients from the model and puts them in the `coefficients` variable.

    "\n",
    "We should more fully unpack the implications of the Jupyter *platform* and what it means to *read* the code. As we mentioned briefly above, the Jupyter platform allows us to interrogate the code and, more importantly, the execution environment described by the code (TODO: find some theory to talk about the relationship between the code and the computation, Ramsay? [Kittler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Kittler), there must be something in [critical code studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_code_studies) that unpacks this) in a performance of *reading* that is theoretically interesting. What we have is an act of reading at the intersection of Underwood and Seller's code, ourselves as critical interpreters, but also the computer as an interpreter (albiet not critical, but what kind of interpreter? *relentlessly literal*). This intersection is made possible by the Jupyter platform because we can work our way through the code, that is, step through it, at our own pace, creating critically meaningful blocks of Underwood and Seller's undifferentiated scripts. The Jupyter platform allows us to incrementally execute these blocks and inspect the state of the execution environment the code instantiates/describes. In this sense we are simultaneously reading the code as a text and as a set of instructions. We can *read into* the code and the computataional work behind the code to achieve a much greater depth. In some sense we can ***test*** our own assumptions about what the code does by actually doing it (TODO: is this there the Berry's *coping tests* come into play?). The moments when we do a *DEFACTOR INSPECTION* and create new code cells with own own code we are simultaneously doing an act of writing and reading. We are writing a *coping test* in order to read the state of the execution environment and *test* our understanding of that state which we we can interpret from our reading of the code, but can also *directly observe with our own code*. \n",
    "\n",
    "What kind of reading is this, it isn't distant reading. It is more akin to *close reading*, but I am not sure the close reading accounts for the interactivity and the inspection work that occurs in our proposed method. Defactoring is a method of reading complex objects and environments, a way of reading the code and the model of reality it instantiates. In making such a claim it is vitally important to understand the material circumstances that make this possible, that is to understand that the Jupyter *platform* is intimately wrapped up in the methodological construct. Defactoring cannot be pure theoretical method, it has to be practically grounded, we might say, *codified* in a technical platform. This isn't such an outrageous thing to say as book historians have been pointing out the material conditions of the monograph and its relationship to knowledge for ages (CITATION-NEEDED).\n",
    "\n",
    "This insight is nothing new to platform or code studies people who have spilled a shoal of ink discussing and debating this point. However, what has been lacking are efforts to *embody* these insights in an interrogation of code, computations, algorithms, and data. We have gone beyond simply pointing out the material conditions of code and *done something with it*. Queue the theory vs. practice divide, but we argue for the construction of bridges and the crossing back and forth precisely because it allows us an avenue towards deeper insight into the production of data and computationally inflected knowledge–such as the work of Underwood and Sellers in Pace of Change. \n",
    "\n",
    "We argue the attributes of data-driven, computational, and algorithmic scholarship such as Pace of Change warrants a different kind of peer review, a form of review that dives into the code (we'd also argue it warrants a different kind of publishing, but we can only address one issue at a time ;). Given the fact the data and the code are just as important as charts and the write-up that are currently the currency of scholarly publishing and communication. \n",

    "#### Software Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "[This blog post by Konrad Hinsen](http://blog.khinsen.net/posts/2017/01/13/sustainable-software-and-reproducible-research-dealing-with-software-collapse/) talks about the sustainability and reproducibility of scientific software, I think many of the points are relevant here. Specific he talks about *software collapse*, which is the foundations of scientific software become unstable and the code/softare used in a discovery ceases to function. He prefers the *collapse* metaphor to the more common *rot* metaphoe because if emphasises the fact the software hasn't change but the context surrounding that software, the foundations, have changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interestion point from the post are the four layers of scientific software. These are useful for us with respect to Defactoring because it helps illuminate the specific kind of software/code we are looking to focus our attention upon. In Hinsen's model there are four layers of scientific software:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Non-scientific, or generalized computational infrastructure like operating systems, compilers, and user interfaces. In `paceofchange` this would be the Docker container and Python runtimes (and everything underneath them) that make up the environment.\n",
    "2. Scientific computational infrastructure, which includes the generalized  libraries implementing particular algorithms or data structures commonly used across scientific settings. For us, this includes the 3rd party libraries like the Logistic Regession implementation from `scikit-learn.`\n",
    "3. Hinsen posits there is a third layer of disciplin-specific research software that are similar to those in layer two, but specialized for a specific disciplinary community. There isn't an example with this specific project, but Matt Jocker's [syuzhet](https://github.com/mjockers/syuzhet) package for R would be a good example for literary analysis.\n",
    "4. The fourth layer is project specific code developed in pursuit of the very specific set of tasks associated with a particular analysis. This code often includes plumbing code that connects the other layers to accomplish a desired outcome, such as performing a logistic regression to create a predictive model of reviewed and unreviewed poetry volumes. The code that we have described in this notebook would be an example of this kind of project specific software.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model of different software layers helps explain the kinds of code most suitable for Defactoring, the fourth player–project specific code. As Hinson points out, layer four software is the least likely to be shared or preserved because it is bespoke code intended only for a specific use case. What we hope to achieve is the creation of ag mechnism that would make this code integral to the publication process and thus make publishing forth layer code a requirement for computational and data intensive research. While it is wonderful to share this code, there needs to be stronger incentives to distribute this kind of code, so argue layer four code needs to be peer-reviewed alongside the narrative that uses it. Defactoring provides a method for reviewing this kind of code and contribute to the editorial aspect of formal scholarly publishing pipelines.\n",
