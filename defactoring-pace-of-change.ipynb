    "TODO: introductory remarks about the defactoring process\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the byproducts of defactoring is a deconstruction of the structure of the code. (heh) Yet, the implementation of what we doing is completely different, at least conceptually, from deconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "There is something processually different betwen deconstructing a text and deconstructing code. Where you would take a text and try to identify its meaningful sub-parts and their relations, with code, we are mirroring that process and putting the carefully deconstructed parts back together into one large linear narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good code is already deconstructed (refactored) into modules and composable parts, we are in effect turning good code into sub-optimal code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NOtes on defactoring and writing computational narratives in the Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What do you do with helper functions? How should helper functions be interwoven into a linear computational narrative?\n",
    "- the global namespace is polluted as fuck\n",
    "- We actually infer 1 possible execution path in this notebook (analyzing *all* exectution paths would be humanly infeasible: what do we do with code that isn't part of that path, do we represent it or not?\n",
    "- What do we do with code that isn't executed as a result of the settings by Ted? We are including some of the non executed code (because ??) but not all of the non executed code. We don't have a very good rationale for this at the moment.\n",
    "- Observation: It would require a book-sized examination to do full justice to code and execution pathways of this article. There are multiple potential pathways, rivers and tributaries of data and computation. To fully realize DEFACTORING as a critical method is to explicate all possibilities...but to do this is infeasble (at least without computational assistance). What would it mean to computationally explore these alternatives? \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the code, we had a question about \"what do they mean by *volume*?\" in the Pace of Change article.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer, to be confirmed, lives in the [Understanding Genre in a Collection of a Million Volumes](https://figshare.com/articles/Understanding_Genre_in_a_Collection_of_a_Million_Volumes_Interim_Report/1281251). Basically, the idea of \"volume\" comes from the Hathi Trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Volume is equivalent to book. Volume is the Hathi Trust unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "> We worked with HathiTrust, which contains the aggregated collections of large public and university libraries; in the period we’re considering (1820-1919), that gave us a collection of roughly 758,400 books in English, of which about 53,200 include significant amounts of poetry. This doesn’t exhaustively cover print culture; it’s still a sample, with particular selection biases. (page 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "It would seem the 53,200 number comes from the fact that Ted has page level genre information. The details of this can be found in an additional figshare repository, [Page-leve genre metadata](https://figshare.com/articles/Page_Level_Genre_Metadata_for_English_Language_Volumes_in_HathiTrust_1700_1922/1279201) where:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Volumes of pentry often include proce introduction, or front and back matter; this was trimmed using publicly-available metadata. (page 33)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how he was able to extract individual poems from the Hathi Trust data.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: We are going to need to be a bit more formal about how we represent the processes that created the data used in this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joris and Matt had short discussion the potential for confounds in the *random* sample which might have skewed that sample because it had the potential to include reviewed poetry. Pages 33 and 34 for the Pace of Change talk about the sampling and data preparation. We needed to talk through exactly what they did to understand it fully. After our discussion we agreed with their reasoning, but we would have liked to see a few more numbers. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "> when a stray volume from the random set turns up near the top of our model’s list of books likely to be reviewed, it does turn out that many of those authors are reasonably well-known (Rupert Brooke, Elaine Goodale Eastman). (page 33)\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to see more supporting data about the ratio between well-known and not-well-known authors popping up at the top of the model's list of books. Perhaps this is splitting hairs, but it would be good to have this supporting data. This however raises the question about how to formalize the \"well-knownness\" of a particular author. This utlimately might be more of a commentary upon our total ignorance of 19th century poetry, Matt and Joris are not English literary scholars (Joris is a Dutch literary scholar) and as such neither of us know very much about 19th century poets. Basically, we don't know much about Rupert Brooke and Elaine Goodale Eastman. This is perhaps a minor nitpick.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our question is \"How many *well-known* authors were in the random sample?\""

From what we can tell from the code and Ted's comment, there poems that are reviewed, there are poems that are obscure, and there are poems that are not in the reviewed set but are never-the-less part of the cannon. This means they are \"known\" and, according to Ted's comment, trumps the conflict when the author is known (`obscure = 'known'`) but not explicitly in the reviewed set. \n",

Note, we are including code from a conditional block that doesn't execute, but are not going out the additional step to include non-executed function defined elsewhere in the code.

In the code cell above, there are many functions we are *stepping over*, like `len`, `list`, `append`, `pop`, `random.sample`, etc., because they are black-boxed.

    "This is an important section of code because it contains the code for the selection of the 3200 word-features, or \"variables\" as he calls them on page 35 (the methodology appendix), used in the logistic regression. Most notable is the code that has been commented out at the very end of the block. The heuristic for feature selection was simply to select the 3200 most common words, a simple and easy to explain technique (also easy to implement with Python's Counter collection). The comment discusses an alternative feature selection technique using binormal selection which he has implemented in the function `binormal_selection`. Because this code is commented out, we do not explore it in-depth here. More interesting is the rationale about *why* it has been commented out:\n",

This points to a crucial problem at the intersection of humanities and computer science where the dissemination of description of statistical methods are inhibiting or hindering the full realization of the epistemlogical richness of computation as a method of inquiry.

    "\n",
    "At a very high level, logistic regression is a machine learning algorithm for performing classification. Logistic regression works by estimating the parameters of a function, the *hypothesis representation*, that divides a multidimensional space into two parts (note, in this case we are talking about binomial or binary logistic regression, which classifies things into one of two bins). The hypothesis representation describes a line that winds its way through the space creating what is called the *decision boundary.* Every data point that lands on one side the boundary gets one label and every data point on the other side of the boundary gets the other label. Similar to linear regression, the goal is to find the best hypothesis representation, that is, the function that best draws a line that divides the space given your already classified data. Once you have a good hypothesis representation, and appropriately *fit* model, you can begin to classify *new* data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to logistic regression is estimating the parameters of the hypothesis representation. We can derive the parameters by using the *features* of existing data combined with their already known labels; this is called *training data*. The modeling process, the function call to `newmodel.fit(trainingset, yvals)` in Ted's code above, uses training data–the matrix of poem features in the `data` variable and known labels ('reviewed' or 'random') in the `classvector` variable–to \"learn\" the parameters through a process called *gradient descent* (note: scikit-learn uses a different process called [*coordinate descent*](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression) which is exceptionally complex). How gradient descent or the more advanced optimization functions like coordinate descent work are well beyond the scope of the discussion (and our explanatory power) so we will just nod and gesture towards the mathematical magic performed by the `newmodel.fit(trainingset, yvals)` function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems when fitting a logistic regression model is a tendency towards *overfitting*. Crudely this means the model, the function and set of parameters, you estimated have tailored themselves so that they are overly optimized to the data you have. As such, the model becomes less useful for *prediction* or classifying any new data you might encounter. In Ted's case, he is fitting a model based upon all of the poems and their classifications *except one (or a few by the same author)* which he then uses to predict if the *held out* poem was 'reviewed' or 'random.' If he *overfits* the model, it will to a terrible job guessing the status of the held out poem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is a technique for logistic regression (and other machine learning algorithms) which helps smooth out the tendency toward overfitting with some more mathematical gymnastics that we don't quite have the power to explain with word, but we can explain visually. The diagram below shows how regularization can help with the fitness of the model."
