    "# Defactoring Pace of Change\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in what the process and practice looks like of 'defactoring' code. Defactoring code can be understood as close reading the source code of a particular software. This may serve multiple purposes. The process might be geared towards peer reviewing code, it may be done to understand methodological aspects and implications, it may be used as a tool to disseminate and teach such new methodologies or how to use them. Here we use the process of defactoring to produce what might be the first critical edition of any source code in the domain of digital humanities. We unpack the code that Ted Underwood wrote to do the analysis that was reported on in the article he wrote together with Jordan Sellers *How Quickly Do Literary Standards Change?* (Underwood, T. & Sellers, J., 2015. *How Quickly Do Literary Standards Change?* Available at: https://figshare.com/articles/How_Quickly_Do_Literary_Standards_Change_/1418394\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that we are  going to defactor can be found in the Github repository where Underwood open sourced it: https://github.com/tedunderwood/paceofchange\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no given definition of 'defactoring' or its practice. We expect there to be some agreement about the aim and purpose of the process (that can be broadly understood as attempting to understand what a particular piece of code is doing). How this process of understanding is implemented is not prescribed and may take many forms. A potential approach is simply 'using the code' in similar analytic processes, however that would not generate much insights into the actual code that in that case is treated as a black box. Backward engineering where one—in th most narrow understanding of this tactic to unpack code—tries to estimate what code is doing by comparing input and output may give some more insights. Writing automated tests that gauge the different responses to input might yet be another approach. Here however we are interested in a deep and intimate understanding of code [Frabretti 2012] to understand how it is adding or changing methodology and how it could be critiqued. For this we think meticulously deconstructing the code—which it allows us to do as it is open source—works best. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code is made up of instructions that are knit together in a process that may included repetition and process paths that branch out and merge back into a main process. Even fairly simple code may thus result in a 'garden of forking paths' that allows for a combinatorial explosion of possible paths that could be walked. It would require a book-sized examination to do full justice to the code and all its possible execution pathways. Even though Underwood's code is not even particular long in comparison to other code bases, there are multiple potential pathways and various choices as to what data to use, liek rivers and tributaries of data and computation. To fully realize defactoring as a critical method possibly means to explicate all possible routes through some code base. This is certainly infeasble within the scope of this article. It would also require considerable computational hardware and assistance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus it is infeasible to represent here *all* execution paths, let alone deeply inspecting them. We chose therefore to deconstruct so that we follow 1 possible execution path through Underwood and Sellers' code that we think presents a good trade off between getting to know the code and actually being able to finish deconstructing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In technical terms the deconstruction that is presented here is a refactoring of Underwood and Sellers' code so that it can be represented as a single computational list of computing instructions, on in one namespace. Underwood and Sellers purposely divided their code into logical and meaningfull parts, modules, and functions that work together. For a code author this is a means of understanding, keeping track, and controling the process of creating and executing an analysis. We found however that to gain insight in how the code works and especially to narrate and disseminate its working it is useful to refactor the code into what is usually understood as a poor coding practice, namely making it all one single long strongly integrated process. This makes the code resemble more of a linear narrative. We may have stumbled here on a difference between the nature of code and text, or the relative mutual excluding of forms of representation that are in one form, divided and branched, useful to a software developer (to organize a process of analysis), and in another form, linear and narrative, more useful for a human interpreter. What we observed also is that the process of deconstruction literature and code are not symetrical but mirrored. Where deconstruction of literature usually involves it being taking apart into its various components, meanings, and contetualizations, we found that deconstructing softare by defactoring means to get an understanding of the code, its functioning, and meaning by integrating its different and disaparate parts into one single linear computational narrative. Able and 'good practices' informed code, in other words seems already deconstructed (or 'refactored') into modules and composable parts. Underwood and Sellers in this manner deconstructed the problem of analyzing poems with the specific methodology they envisioned. For all practical purposes we effectively are turning well articulated code into sub-optimal code full of 'hacks' and 'code smells'. However, we do think this leverages our ability to understand the narrative that the code also is.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found it useful to intersperes the various logial parts of the code, those parts that seem to handle a clearly bounded 'step' in the algorithmic process, with narrative that reports on how we understood the code and its functioning at that moment of deconstruction. The Jupyter Notebook is a good fit for presenting this exploration of the code. It allows us to present a fully functioning (executable) code path, divided into steps that can be read and commented by us. Reading (and executing along the way) this notebook therefore gives the reader a close resembling of the experience of how we as deconstructionists 'close read' the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support ourselves in the reading process (and hopefully also the reader now) we found it useful to keep track of the 'state' of the code as it was executing. We implemented this by listing all the 'active' variables and there values at each step of the process. The explanation of each step is therefore also ammended with a listing of these variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating code parts that were purposefully decoupled is not without risk of introducing bugs and cripling the code. For instance, if there are two variables with the same name but different function in two distinct codeparts, putting these code parts into one computational narrative will result in these variables conflicting, possibly overwriting one with the other with uncertain results or broken code as a consequence. Luckily the code of Underwood and Sellers was of such composition that we did not run into these kind of troubles and where potential conflict occured it was easy enough to counter it by renaming variables or introducing little bits of helper code that do not change the general signature of the code. We have altered the code written by Underwood and Sellers. The letter is changed in some places, but we contend that the spirit of the work is the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remark that the changes and additions we introduced to the code indeed are interpetations and emandations of the code: they are critical interventions just like a textual scholar would undertake, for instance, when critically editing and interpreteing a historic text. We do indeed think that the Jupyter Notebook (or rather its content) that is the result of our close examination of Underwoods and Seller's code can be considered the first 'critical edition' of a codebase within the digital humanities. As with firsts, we do realize that our method is probably imperfect and susceptible to many improvements. That however is exactly the purpose of our work here: to explore the valuable and feasible forms of code criticism and its epistemic role in the humanities. [TODO: this needs some STS facing additions too.]\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the code, we had a question about \"what do they mean by *volume*?\" in the Pace of Change article.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer, to be confirmed, lives in the [Understanding Genre in a Collection of a Million Volumes](https://figshare.com/articles/Understanding_Genre_in_a_Collection_of_a_Million_Volumes_Interim_Report/1281251). Basically, the idea of \"volume\" comes from the Hathi Trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Volume is equivalent to book. Volume is the Hathi Trust unit. \n",
    "\n",
    "> We worked with HathiTrust, which contains the aggregated collections of large public and university libraries; in the period we’re considering (1820-1919), that gave us a collection of roughly 758,400 books in English, of which about 53,200 include significant amounts of poetry. This doesn’t exhaustively cover print culture; it’s still a sample, with particular selection biases. (page 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "It would seem the 53,200 number comes from the fact that Ted has page level genre information. The details of this can be found in an additional figshare repository, [Page-leve genre metadata](https://figshare.com/articles/Page_Level_Genre_Metadata_for_English_Language_Volumes_in_HathiTrust_1700_1922/1279201) where:\n",

    "\n",
    "TODO: We are going to need to be a bit more formal about how we represent the processes that created the data used in this code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joris and Matt had short discussion the potential for confounds in the *random* sample which might have skewed that sample because it had the potential to include reviewed poetry. Pages 33 and 34 for the Pace of Change talk about the sampling and data preparation. We needed to talk through exactly what they did to understand it fully. After our discussion we agreed with their reasoning, but we would have liked to see a few more numbers. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "> when a stray volume from the random set turns up near the top of our model’s list of books likely to be reviewed, it does turn out that many of those authors are reasonably well-known (Rupert Brooke, Elaine Goodale Eastman). (page 33)\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to see more supporting data about the ratio between well-known and not-well-known authors popping up at the top of the model's list of books. Perhaps this is splitting hairs, but it would be good to have this supporting data. This however raises the question about how to formalize the \"well-knownness\" of a particular author. This utlimately might be more of a commentary upon our total ignorance of 19th century poetry, Matt and Joris are not English literary scholars (Joris is a Dutch literary scholar) and as such neither of us know very much about 19th century poets. Basically, we don't know much about Rupert Brooke and Elaine Goodale Eastman. This is perhaps a minor nitpick.\n",

    "This is an important section of code because it contains the code for the selection of the 3200 word-features, or \"variables\" as he calls them on page 35 (the methodology appendix), used in the logistic regression. Most notable is the code that has been commented out at the very end of the block. The heuristic for feature selection was simply to select the 3200 most common words, a simple and easy to explain technique (also easy to implement with Python's Counter collection). The comment discusses an alternative feature selection technique using binormal selection which he has implemented in the function `binormal_selection`. Because this code is commented out, we do not explore it in-depth here. More interesting is the rationale about *why* it has been commented out:\n",

This points to a crucial problem at the intersection of humanities and computer science where the dissemination of description of statistical methods are inhibiting or hindering the full realization of the epistemlogical richness of computation as a method of inquiry.

    "\n",
    "At a very high level, logistic regression is a machine learning algorithm for performing classification. Logistic regression works by estimating the parameters of a function, the *hypothesis representation*, that divides a multidimensional space into two parts (note, in this case we are talking about binomial or binary logistic regression, which classifies things into one of two bins). The hypothesis representation describes a line that winds its way through the space creating what is called the *decision boundary.* Every data point that lands on one side the boundary gets one label and every data point on the other side of the boundary gets the other label. Similar to linear regression, the goal is to find the best hypothesis representation, that is, the function that best draws a line that divides the space given your already classified data. Once you have a good hypothesis representation, and appropriately *fit* model, you can begin to classify *new* data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to logistic regression is estimating the parameters of the hypothesis representation. We can derive the parameters by using the *features* of existing data combined with their already known labels; this is called *training data*. The modeling process, the function call to `newmodel.fit(trainingset, yvals)` in Ted's code above, uses training data–the matrix of poem features in the `data` variable and known labels ('reviewed' or 'random') in the `classvector` variable–to \"learn\" the parameters through a process called *gradient descent* (note: scikit-learn uses a different process called [*coordinate descent*](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression) which is exceptionally complex). How gradient descent or the more advanced optimization functions like coordinate descent work are well beyond the scope of the discussion (and our explanatory power) so we will just nod and gesture towards the mathematical magic performed by the `newmodel.fit(trainingset, yvals)` function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems when fitting a logistic regression model is a tendency towards *overfitting*. Crudely this means the model, the function and set of parameters, you estimated have tailored themselves so that they are overly optimized to the data you have. As such, the model becomes less useful for *prediction* or classifying any new data you might encounter. In Ted's case, he is fitting a model based upon all of the poems and their classifications *except one (or a few by the same author)* which he then uses to predict if the *held out* poem was 'reviewed' or 'random.' If he *overfits* the model, it will to a terrible job guessing the status of the held out poem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is a technique for logistic regression (and other machine learning algorithms) which helps smooth out the tendency toward overfitting with some more mathematical gymnastics that we don't quite have the power to explain with word, but we can explain visually. The diagram below shows how regularization can help with the fitness of the model."
