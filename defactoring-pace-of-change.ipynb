    "# Defactoring Pace of Change\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in what the process and practice looks like of 'defactoring' code. Defactoring code can be understood as close reading the source code of a particular software. This may serve multiple purposes. The process might be geared towards peer reviewing code, it may be done to understand methodological aspects and implications, it may be used as a tool to disseminate and teach such new methodologies or how to use them. Here we use the process of defactoring to produce what might be the first critical edition of any source code in the domain of digital humanities. We unpack the code that Ted Underwood wrote to do the analysis that was reported on in the article he wrote together with Jordan Sellers *How Quickly Do Literary Standards Change?* (Underwood, T. & Sellers, J., 2015. *How Quickly Do Literary Standards Change?* Available at: https://figshare.com/articles/How_Quickly_Do_Literary_Standards_Change_/1418394\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that we are  going to defactor can be found in the Github repository where Underwood open sourced it: https://github.com/tedunderwood/paceofchange\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no given definition of 'defactoring' or its practice. We expect there to be some agreement about the aim and purpose of the process (that can be broadly understood as attempting to understand what a particular piece of code is doing). How this process of understanding is implemented is not prescribed and may take many forms. A potential approach is simply 'using the code' in similar analytic processes, however that would not generate much insights into the actual code that in that case is treated as a black box. Backward engineering where one—in th most narrow understanding of this tactic to unpack code—tries to estimate what code is doing by comparing input and output may give some more insights. Writing automated tests that gauge the different responses to input might yet be another approach. Here however we are interested in a deep and intimate understanding of code [Frabretti 2012] to understand how it is adding or changing methodology and how it could be critiqued. For this we think meticulously deconstructing the code—which it allows us to do as it is open source—works best. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code is made up of instructions that are knit together in a process that may included repetition and process paths that branch out and merge back into a main process. Even fairly simple code may thus result in a 'garden of forking paths' that allows for a combinatorial explosion of possible paths that could be walked. It would require a book-sized examination to do full justice to the code and all its possible execution pathways. Even though Underwood's code is not even particular long in comparison to other code bases, there are multiple potential pathways and various choices as to what data to use, liek rivers and tributaries of data and computation. To fully realize defactoring as a critical method possibly means to explicate all possible routes through some code base. This is certainly infeasble within the scope of this article. It would also require considerable computational hardware and assistance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus it is infeasible to represent here *all* execution paths, let alone deeply inspecting them. We chose therefore to deconstruct so that we follow 1 possible execution path through Underwood and Sellers' code that we think presents a good trade off between getting to know the code and actually being able to finish deconstructing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In technical terms the deconstruction that is presented here is a refactoring of Underwood and Sellers' code so that it can be represented as a single computational list of computing instructions, on in one namespace. Underwood and Sellers purposely divided their code into logical and meaningfull parts, modules, and functions that work together. For a code author this is a means of understanding, keeping track, and controling the process of creating and executing an analysis. We found however that to gain insight in how the code works and especially to narrate and disseminate its working it is useful to refactor the code into what is usually understood as a poor coding practice, namely making it all one single long strongly integrated process. This makes the code resemble more of a linear narrative. We may have stumbled here on a difference between the nature of code and text, or the relative mutual excluding of forms of representation that are in one form, divided and branched, useful to a software developer (to organize a process of analysis), and in another form, linear and narrative, more useful for a human interpreter. What we observed also is that the process of deconstruction literature and code are not symetrical but mirrored. Where deconstruction of literature usually involves it being taking apart into its various components, meanings, and contetualizations, we found that deconstructing softare by defactoring means to get an understanding of the code, its functioning, and meaning by integrating its different and disaparate parts into one single linear computational narrative. Able and 'good practices' informed code, in other words seems already deconstructed (or 'refactored') into modules and composable parts. Underwood and Sellers in this manner deconstructed the problem of analyzing poems with the specific methodology they envisioned. For all practical purposes we effectively are turning well articulated code into sub-optimal code full of 'hacks' and 'code smells'. However, we do think this leverages our ability to understand the narrative that the code also is.\n",
    "\n",
    "We found it useful to intersperes the various logial parts of the code, those parts that seem to handle a clearly bounded 'step' in the algorithmic process, with narrative that reports on how we understood the code and its functioning at that moment of deconstruction. The Jupyter Notebook is a good fit for presenting this exploration of the code. It allows us to present a fully functioning (executable) code path, divided into steps that can be read and commented by us. Reading (and executing along the way) this notebook therefore gives the reader a close resembling of the experience of how we as deconstructionists 'close read' the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support ourselves in the reading process (and hopefully also the reader now) we found it useful to keep track of the 'state' of the code as it was executing. We implemented this by listing all the 'active' variables and there values at each step of the process. The explanation of each step is therefore also ammended with a listing of these variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating code parts that were purposefully decoupled is not without risk of introducing bugs and cripling the code. For instance, if there are two variables with the same name but different function in two distinct codeparts, putting these code parts into one computational narrative will result in these variables conflicting, possibly overwriting one with the other with uncertain results or broken code as a consequence. Luckily the code of Underwood and Sellers was of such composition that we did not run into these kind of troubles and where potential conflict occured it was easy enough to counter it by renaming variables or introducing little bits of helper code that do not change the general signature of the code. We have altered the code written by Underwood and Sellers. The letter is changed in some places, but we contend that the spirit of the work is the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remark that the changes and additions we introduced to the code indeed are interpretations and emandations of the code: they are critical interventions just like a textual scholar would undertake, for instance, when critically editing and interpreting a historic text. We do indeed think that the Jupyter Notebook (or rather its content) that is the result of our close examination of Underwood's and Seller's code can be considered the first 'critical edition' of a codebase within the digital humanities. As with firsts, we do realize that our method is probably imperfect and susceptible to many improvements. That however is exactly the purpose of our work here: to explore the valuable and feasible forms of code criticism and its epistemic role in the humanities. [TODO: this needs some STS facing additions too.]"

    "## What is *Defactoring*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Defactoring* is a process or possible a tool for \"[opening the black box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboxing)\" of computational and data intensive scholarship. It is similar to the process of *[refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring)* in that we are \"restructuring existing computing code without changing its external behavior.\" Typically, refactoring takes code and bundles it into a separate structure, such as a function or module, to make it more reusable and recombinable. Our efforts here have done just the opposite. We have taken code that was broken up over several functions and files and pulled it into a single, linear narrative. This process invokes *deconstructive* analytic in which we have *internally* vivisected Underwood and Sellers' code, but externally there is little change to the behavior or outputs. These reconfigurations enable us to unpack, drill-down, and dig into the code within the same platform we use to write about the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defactoring, as a method of analysis, is deeply imbricated with a technical platform (just as Underwood & Sellers' data, code, and analysis are as well). But rather than pushing the code into a distant repository separate from the prosaic narrative, we compose a *[computational narrative](http://blog.jupyter.org/2015/07/07/project-jupyter-computational-narratives-as-the-engine-of-collaborative-data-science/)* whereby the data, code, and expository text are bundled together. This means we have created a document that can be read by both humans and machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such a feat is made possible by the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.com). The particular [affordances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance) of the Notebook allow us to weave code, data, and prose together into a single narrative that is simultaneously readable and executable. Given our purpose, to develop a method for critically engaging the code of computational scholarship, it is imperative to foreground Underwood & Sellers' code and Notebooks *afford* a technical mechanism for doing just that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### So what did we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "At a practical level, we have *forked* code from the [git repository](https://github.com/tedunderwood/paceofchange) to create a new *branch* containing this Notebook you are reading now. \n",
    "\n",
    "Underwood and Sellers' have crafted their code such that it relatively easy to replicate their results by simply running a single command. One of the first tasks was to look at the code and follow the path of execution from that initial command. In reading through the code (as contained in multiple `.py` files) we could piece together a rough idea of how Underwood and Sellers' performed their data preparation, normalization, and analysis. However, `.py` files leave much to be desired when it comes to readability and annotateablility. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then copied python code from the various files in the repository into a Jupyter Notebook. Not all of the code in the repository was copied into the notebook for three main reasons. First, not all of the code included in the files is actually needed to replicate the analysis process. The repository includes a bunch of extra code, one could call it \"cruft\", from exploratory analysis or earlier iterations of the analytical process. For example, the file `SonicScrewdiver.py` is never called upon although, based upon the name, we might hypothesize it is an important, catch-all, modules for a variety of different tasks. Other sections of the code, are valid code, but function calls are commented out (such as `binormal_select`) and never executed. We have opted not to include these unused functions or code blocks. Second, not all of the possible execution paths are being analyzed in this Notebook. There six allowable options for slicing the data in `replicate.py`, the entry-point for re-running the analysis. We opted to follow the default, \"full\", which will model the entire dataset. Third, there is a large amount of code that is part of third party libraries, such as the logistic regression implementation that is part of `scikit-learn`, for a multitude of reasons (including practicality) we have decided to \"step over\", and not copy third-party code into this notebook. When trying to follow the path of execution for any program one needs to recognize it is \"[turtles all the way down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down).\" To make our task possible, we have to make a decision about how far down the path of execution the defactoring process will go. We make a decision to focus only on the code written by Underwood and Sellers and leave an analysis of subsequent third-party libraries to a later, and more ambitious, defactoring effort."

    "\n",
    "In order for the code to execute seamlessly within the notebook, we had to make minor changes and tweaks to the code. These changes fall into 5 categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *defactoring functions* - This is the most significant of the changes. When we defactor a function we take the function's code and move it to the global namespace. This has the effect of elimiating the function and just making it part of the main execution path. \n",
    "* *defactoring function calls* - When a function has been defactored, it can no longer be called since there is no explicit definitional code.\n",
    "* *defactoring definitions* - Not all functions can be fully defactored. Functions that are called more than once or those that are short have been kept as re-usable functions. Defactoring Definition cells define the functions above the code cells that use them (preventing errors).\n",
    "* *defactoring namespace* - Because we have defactored some of the functions and their function calls some of the variables in the namespace need to be mapped to eachother. This happens we the return value of a defactored function needs to be stored in a differently named variable.\n",
    "* *defactoring inspections* - When we want to inspect the state of the process, we insert an inspection cell that prints the values of the variables of interest.\n",
    "* *defactoring import* - Because the code is reliant upon external and third party functions, we need to import that code into the global namespace. This cell contains all of those imports.[TODO: move all imports to one cell at the top]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages to defactoring a function is it affords us the ability to insert critical commentary (in the form of markdown cells) into the code constituting the function itself. An unfortunate side-effect is that this makes keeping track of one's place in the code a bit difficult. "

This doesn’t exhaustively cover print culture; it’s still a sample, with particular selection biases. (page 5)\n",

The decision to include or not include `sort_by_proximity()` is a breadth issue. How broad should we be in including code that does not execute? Note, we are including code from a conditional block that doesn't execute, but are not going out the additional step to include non-executed function defined elsewhere in the code. The decision to include or not include code from the standard library, code not written by Ted, is a depth issue. In the code cell above, there are many functions we are *stepping over*, like `len`, `list`, `append`, `pop`, `random.sample`, etc., because they are black-boxed. There is no need to critique or test or inspect those functions because they have been tested and evaluated  thoroughly outside of the scope of Ted's project [We need a strong REF here].\n",

The heuristic for feature selection was simply to select the 3200 most common words, a simple and easy to explain technique (also easy to implement with Python's Counter collection).

    "#### Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Our investigation into the mechanisms of logistic regression were driven by the question \"what is the regularization value?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This lead us spend some time watching [Andrew Ng explain classification using Logistic Regression](https://class.coursera.org/ml-005/lecture) on his Coursera course.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a very high level, logistic regression is a machine learning algorithm for performing classification. Logistic regression works by estimating the parameters of a function, the *hypothesis representation*, that divides a multidimensional space into two parts (note, in this case we are talking about binomial or binary logistic regression, which classifies things into one of two bins). The hypothesis representation describes a line that winds its way through the space creating what is called the *decision boundary.* Every data point that lands on one side the boundary gets one label and every data point on the other side of the boundary gets the other label. Similar to linear regression, the goal is to find the best hypothesis representation, that is, the function that best draws a line that divides the space given your already classified data. Once you have a good hypothesis representation, and appropriately *fit* model, you can begin to classify *new* data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to logistic regression is estimating the parameters of the hypothesis representation. We can derive the parameters by using the *features* of existing data combined with their already known labels; this is called *training data*. The modeling process, the function call to `newmodel.fit(trainingset, yvals)` in Ted's code above, uses training data–the matrix of poem features in the `data` variable and known labels ('reviewed' or 'random') in the `classvector` variable–to \"learn\" the parameters through a process called *gradient descent* (note: scikit-learn uses a different process called [*coordinate descent*](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#logistic-regression) which is exceptionally complex). How gradient descent or the more advanced optimization functions like coordinate descent work are well beyond the scope of the discussion (and our explanatory power) so we will just nod and gesture towards the mathematical magic performed by the `newmodel.fit(trainingset, yvals)` function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems when fitting a logistic regression model is a tendency towards *overfitting*. Crudely this means the model, the function and set of parameters, you estimated have tailored themselves so that they are overly optimized to the data you have. As such, the model becomes less useful for *prediction* or classifying any new data you might encounter. In Ted's case, he is fitting a model based upon all of the poems and their classifications *except one (or a few by the same author)* which he then uses to predict if the *held out* poem was 'reviewed' or 'random.' If he *overfits* the model, it will to a terrible job guessing the status of the held out poem. \n",
